# **CS 255: DriverPass Project Portfolio Submission**

## **Project Overview**  
The DriverPass project was designed for a client who wanted to improve how learners prepare for their driving tests. The client, **DriverPass**, requested a system that allows learners to:  
- Book driving practice lessons  
- Take practice tests  
- Access educational resources  

The goal was to streamline the learner’s experience while also providing tools for instructors and administrators to manage lessons, feedback, and user progress.  

The final design includes features such as lesson scheduling, progress tracking, secure user management, and external system integration for DMV updates. These features ensure that the platform meets the needs of all stakeholders: learners, instructors, and administrators.

## **What I Did Well**  
I did particularly well in **organizing and documenting the user requirements** in the business requirements document. I thoroughly analyzed the client’s needs and prioritized the most critical system functionalities, such as lesson scheduling and progress tracking.  

Additionally, I created clear **UML diagrams** in the system design document to visually represent the system's workflows and relationships. These diagrams, including activity and class diagrams, helped communicate the design effectively and made the system’s structure easy to understand.

## **What I Would Improve**  
If I were to revise one part of my work, I would focus on improving the **user experience (UX) details** in the system design document. While I documented the functional requirements well, I could have provided more visual elements, such as interface mockups or wireframes, to illustrate how the system would look and feel for users.  

To improve this in the future, I would use tools like **Figma** or **Adobe XD** to create user interface prototypes, providing a clearer picture of the design for stakeholders.

## **Understanding and Implementing User Needs**  
To interpret the client’s needs, I carefully analyzed the interview transcript to identify the core features required:  
- **Scheduling driving lessons** with instructors  
- Allowing learners to **take practice tests** and receive immediate feedback  
- **Tracking learner progress** using detailed analytics  

These requirements were translated into clear functional and nonfunctional requirements in the system design document.  

**Why this matters:** Prioritizing user needs is essential for creating a successful system. A system that fails to address user requirements or frustrates users can result in low adoption and poor user satisfaction. By focusing on user goals, the DriverPass design ensures that learners, instructors, and administrators have an efficient and user-friendly experience.

## **My Approach to Designing Software**  
My approach to software design follows a structured process:  
1. **Understanding Requirements**: I begin by thoroughly gathering user requirements through interviews and documentation.  
2. **Visualizing the System**: I create **UML diagrams** like activity diagrams, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams to illustrate system workflows and relationships.  
3. **Prioritizing Features**: I focus on the most critical features first, ensuring the system meets the users' needs and aligns with the project goals.  
4. **Iterative Feedback**: I design in phases, gathering feedback at each stage to refine and improve the design.  

In the future, I will continue to use tools like **Lucidchart** for diagrams, **GitHub** for version control, and **Figma** for interface prototyping. These tools help ensure clarity, collaboration, and a user-centered design process.

## **Included Documents**  
This repository contains the following artifacts from my work on the DriverPass project:  
1. **Business Requirements Document** (from Project One)  
2. **System Design Document** (from Project Two)  

These documents demonstrate my ability to gather user requirements, analyze the system needs, and design a solution that meets those needs.
