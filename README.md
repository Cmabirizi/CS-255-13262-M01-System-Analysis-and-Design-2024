# System Analysis and Design Portfolio

## Overview
This repository showcases the work completed during the **CS-255: System Analysis and Design** course at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). It includes assignments, projects, and reflections that demonstrate the application of system design principles, the use of UML diagrams, and the analysis of software requirements.

## Contents
- **Module Assignments**: Contains individual assignments completed during the course, such as UML activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, and system requirement analyses.
- **Final Project**: A comprehensive system analysis and design project showcasing the knowledge and skills gained throughout the course.
- **Reflections**: Personal reflections on key lessons learned, challenges faced, and insights gained during the course.

## GitHub Repository Setup
The repository is organized to highlight the following:
- **Version Control**: GitHub was utilized to track changes, maintain version history, and collaborate efficiently.
- **Documentation**: Clear and structured documentation accompanies each project and assignment.
- **Collaboration**: GitHub's collaboration features were employed by adding the instructor (@drstefanelli) as a collaborator.
